I was grateful that the Digital Humanities section of the Library and Information Technology Services Department at Bryn Mawr College sent me to take part in this workshop to think about how I might want to use some of these tools in my research and teaching.

An in progress game being built with Bitsy

### [Noodle King, a Taroko Gorge Remix](taroko-gorge.html)
A computer-generated infinite poem about being a cook in a Chinese restaurant

### [Genevieve Twine](Genevieve.html)
A Twine about an early American explorer to China

### [Working Mom Generator](WorkingMom.html)
A pretty self-explanatory generator of some things that might keep me (or you) up at night
